# baku-explainability

The Data files with all the necessary data for each seperate task has been stored in data_pickle_file folder. 
Within baku folder, you will the various versions of the GUI, you can use the latest version of the GUI to visualize the data from every task by loading that particular pickle file task in the drop down of the GUI.
Project Report has been added for further explainations.

Our method provides a detailed approach to understanding how multi-modal attention networks, like those used in Transformers, combine and process information from different input types, such as text and images. Generating relevancy maps makes it possible to visualise and explain the model's decision-making process, making the model's operations more transparent. This flexible method can be applied to any multi-modal setup, extending beyond just two modalities.

The development of a GUI for visualizing various features within the Libero dataset offers a powerful tool for researchers and engineers in robotics. By integrating diverse data streams into an interactive interface, the GUI enhances the ability to analyze and interpret complex behaviours, supporting debugging, performance evaluation, and the creation of more efficient algorithms. This advancement is poised to significantly contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of robotic systems.
